# Jungle-Beats

This was my first introduction to linked lists. It was an interesting logic exercise and I hope to get back to it to refactor a couple things, most notably the find_tail method. This is currently an O(n) operation because it needs to traverse the whole list. If I can make the tail an ivar I can make this an O(1) operation. I also hope to get the extensions done.
